/// ### General Information ###
/// Scans the filesystem according to given \b ScanParameters and adds \alib{files;FInfo}
/// entries to the given \alib{files;FTree}.
///
/// ### ALib FTree Data Contract ###
/// This function has a contract with class \alib{files;FTree} that is used to store the scan results.
/// This contract states that any file or directory found during a scan is always stored using
/// the <em>"Real Path"</em> of the entry. This means that any symbolic link is resolved.
/// The consequences are:
/// - %Files and directories which represent a symbolic link are always "leaf nodes".
///   (They never contain child nodes.). However, their symlink target path is attached twice
///   to the entry:
///   1. The original link information given, which often uses relative path addressing.
///   2. The absolute, <em>"Real Path"</em> of the target, which has a corresponding result entry
///      in the given \b %FTree.
/// - If a using software wants to use symbolic paths, for example to present them to the end
///   user, such paths have to be assembled by the user's code in own responsibility.
///   All information for doing this is provided in the resulting tree object
/// - Doubly linked target files and directories are never a problem for this scanner. Each
///   file is scanned only once. This especially prevents all sorts of problems that would otherwise
///   occur with cyclic symbolic links.
/// - Due to this, even the given start path of a search might not be found as a result
///   in given \b %FTree, because also start paths are converted to a <em>Real Path</em>.
/// - The scan result may contain more than one resulting path. This happens, if a symbolic link
///   targets a file or directory that is not recursively included in the start path.
///   The resulting <em>"Real Path"</em> of the given start path is however always the first
///   result added.
///
/// The latter is reflected with parameter \p{resultPaths} of this function, which is defined
/// as a <c>std::vector</c>.
///
/// \note
///   As class \alib{files;FTree} is based on class \alib{containers;StringTree}, using code
///   is enabled to break this contract by adding entries below symbolic links.
///   Other entities of this \alibmod_nl will not break this contract.
///
/// ### Rescanning of Entries ###
/// Existing entries in the given \p{tree} are not overwritten. They might be scanned with "higher"
/// \alib{files;FInfo::Qualities} values, depending on given \p{parameters} and how they had been
/// scanned before. If the same "level" of scanning is provided,  existing entries will not be
/// scanned again. If a rescan of a certain path is wanted, then the target entry of that path has
/// to be deleted before invoking this function. Due to the implementation of class FTree, repeated
/// delete and scan operations will not cause any heap-memory activities (of course, as long as no
/// new entries are detected).
///
/// ### platform-dependent Code Selection ###
/// File scanning is a platform-dependent task and hence \b ALib uses one of two different
/// implementations:
/// 1. A posix version for posix compatible OSes,
/// 2. A version that relies on <c>C++ std::filesystem</c>.
///
/// The fallback version using <c>std::filesystem</c> has the following restrictions:
/// - The only time attribute available is the \alib{files;FInfo::MDate;modification time} of
///   an entry. Fields \alib{files::FInfo;BDate}, \alib{files::FInfo;CDate}, and
///   \alib{files::FInfo;ADate} are always set to the same as the
///   modification time, even on filesystems that support the other values.
/// - The file time of symbolic links is \b always that of the target file. The C++ standard has
///   no possibility to access the link's time itself.
/// - The file time of broken symbolic links is set to the current time (time of scanning).
/// - The size that directories occupy on disk cannot be determined. Directory entries always report
///   size <c>0</c>.
/// - The target of a symbolic link which points to a non-accessible directory, cannot be resolved
///   to a 'real' path, even if all other path components before are accessible.
///   (This is true for the implementation of the standard library under GNU/Linux and Clang compiler
///   at the time of writing this, 2024/02.)
/// - Flag \alib{files;ScanParameters::CrossFileSystems} is ignored. Crossing Filesystems cannot
///   be detected using purely the standard library.
/// - A files' owner and owning group is not determined. Instead, \alib{files;FInfo::UnknownID} is
///   set for both.
/// - The scanning process is half as fast as in the Posix version. The reason for this is probably
///   the internal allocation and deallocation of many quite volatile string objects in the C++
///   standard library.
///   Well, but it is still fast though!
///
/// \note As for today, using this module under WindowsOS, will fall back to the
///       <em>C++ std::filesystem</em> version. It may be that a future version will provide a native
///       implementation of this target system. Volunteers from the community are welcome to
///       contribute.
///
/// @param tree        The tree to fill.
/// @param parameters  The input parameters to determine the scan process.
/// @param resultPaths A container to add the resulting list of 'real' paths and corresponding start
///                    nodes found during the search. The first entry added by this function is
///                    always the 'real'-version of field \alib{files::ScanParameters;StartPath}
///                    of the given \p{params} struct. Further paths/nodes pairs are created when
///                    symbolic links are found and followed.
/// @param lock        Pointer to an (optional) \alib{threads;SharedLock}.
///                    The overloaded version of this function that accepts \alib{SharedFTree}

///                    This parameter is available (and to be passed) only if the module
///                    \alib_threads is included in the \alibdist.

/// @return Scan quality code of the tree node of the first resulting path, hence of the node
///         referred to by \alib{files;ScanParameters::StartPath}. If this is erroneous,
///         the start path was invalid, for example, not accessible, a broken link, a circular link,
///         etc.
