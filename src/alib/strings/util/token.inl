/// Tokens in the context of \alib_strings_nl, are human-readable "words" or "symbols" that
/// represent a certain value or entity of software. Tokens may be used with configuration files,
/// mathematical or general expressions, programming languages, communication protocols and so forth.
///
/// This struct contains attributes to describe a token, a method to parse the attributes from a
/// (resource) string and finally method #Match that matches a given string against the token
/// definition.
///
/// ## %Token Format: ##
/// With the construction, respectively the \ref Define "definition" of a token, special formats are
/// detected. These formats are:
/// - <em>"snake_case"</em><br>
/// - <em>"kebab-case"</em><br>
/// - <em>"CamelCase"</em><br>
///
/// \note
///   Information about such case formats is given in this
///   \https{Wikipedia article,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles}.
///
/// \note
///   If the name indicates a mix of \e snake_case, \e kebab-case or \e CamelCase formats
///   (e.g., \e "System_Propery-ValueTable"), then snake_case supersedes both others and kebab-case
///   supersedes CamelCase.
///
/// The format detection is only performed when more than one minimum length is given. In this case,
/// the number of "segments" (e.g., "camel humps") has to match the number of length values.
///
///
/// ## Character Case Sensitivity: ##
/// Independent of the token format (normal or snake_case, kebab-case, CamelCase), character case
/// sensitivity can be chosen. With \e CamelCase and case-sensitive parsing, the first character of
/// the first hump may be defined lower or upper case (called "lowerCamelCase" vs. "UpperCamelCase").
///
/// If none of the special formats is detected, the tokens can optionally be abbreviated by just
/// providing a minimum amount of starting characters as specified by the then single entry
/// in #minLengths.
/// Otherwise, each segment of the token (e.g., "camel hump") can (again optionally) be shortened
/// on its own.
/// As an example, if for token <c>"SystemProperty"</c> the minimum lengths given are
/// \c 3 and \c 4, the minimum abbreviation is <c>"SysProp"</c>, while <c>"SystProper"</c> also
/// matches.<br>
///
///
/// ## Limitation To Seven Segments: ##
/// This class supports minimum length definitions for up to \c 7 "camel humps", respectively
/// segments. Should a name contain even more segments, those cannot be abbreviated.
/// Providing more than \c 7 values for minimum segment lengths with the definition string results
/// in a definition error (see below).
///
///
/// ## Special Treatment For CamelCase: ##
/// ### Omitable Last Camel Hump: ####
/// The minimum length values provided must be greater than \c 0, with one exception:
/// With \e CamelCase format and case-insensitive definition, the last "camel hump" may have a
/// minimum length of \c 0 and hence may be omitted when matched.
/// If so, the "normalized" version of the token, which can be received by
/// \alib{strings;AppendableTraits;appending} an instance to an \alib{strings;TAString;AString}, will have
/// the last letter of the defined name converted to lower case.<br>
/// The rationale for this specific approach is to support the English plural case. This can be best
/// explained in a sample. If a token was defined using definition string:
///
///      "MilliSecondS Ignore 1 1 0"
///
/// then all of the following words match:
///
///      milliseconds
///      MilliSecs
///      millis
///      MSec
///      MSecs
///      MSs
///      ms
///
/// In the case that the rightfully (normalized) spelled token name is to be written, then with
/// the last character converted to lower case, the token becomes
///
///      MilliSeconds
///
/// This is performed with methods #GetExportName (which is also used by the specialization of
/// functor \alib{strings;AppendableTraits} for this type.
/// Hence, when appending a \b Token to an \b AString, if omitable, the last character
/// of the token name is converted to lower case.
///
/// If the above is not suitable, or for any other reasons a different "normalized" name is wanted
/// when writing the token, then method #Define offers a next mechanism to explicitly define
/// any custom string to be written.
///
/// ### Rollback: ####
/// \e CamelCase supports a simple "rollback" mechanism, which is needed for example for token
///
///      "SystemTemperature Ignore 1 1 0"
///
/// and given match argument
///
///      system
///
/// All six characters are matching the first hump, but then there are not characters left to
/// match the start of the second hump \c "Temperature". In this case, a loop of retries is
/// performed by rolling back characters from the back of the hump (\c 'm') and ending with the
/// first optional character of that hump (\c 'y'). The loop will be broken when
/// character \c 't' is found.
///
/// However: This is not continued in the case that the term that was rolled back does not match,
/// yet. This means, that certain (very unlikely!) tokens, with nested repeating character sequences
/// in camel humps, cannot be abbreviated to certain (unlikely wanted) lengths.
///
/// ## Handling Definition Errors: ###
///
/// The definition strings passed to method #Define are considered static (resourced) data.
/// In other words, this definition data should be compile-time defined and not be customizable
/// by end-users, but only by experts.
/// Therefore, only in debug-compilations of the library, a due testing of correctness of the
/// definitions is available.
///
/// The source code of utility namespace function \alib{strings;util::LoadResourcedTokens}
/// demonstrates how error codes defined with enumeration #DbgDefinitionError can be handled in
/// debug-compilations by raising debug-assertions.
