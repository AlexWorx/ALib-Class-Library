ALIB_EXPORT namespace alib::enumrecords::bootstrap {

/// This is a pure static type used for parsing enum records from strings.
/// The static fields are initialized with each method of type \alib{enumrecords;EnumRecords}
/// and therefore implementations of \alib{enumrecords;EnumRecordPrototype::Parse} can rely on finding
/// these fields properly set.
///
/// This concept makes use of the restriction that the setup of
/// \ref alib_enums_records "ALib Enum Records" must exclusively be done during
/// \ref alib_mod_bs "bootstrapping" of software process, where no multi-threading
/// is active, yet.
///
/// If parse errors occur, a <c>std::runtime_error</c> is thrown.
///
/// \alib
///
/// The methods of this type perform strict checks about unnecessary whitespaces, <c>'+'</c>-signs,
/// etc, which also raise an exception. The rationale for this design decision
/// (to not allow unnecessary, but maybe unharmful characters in resources) besides saving memory is,
/// that the occurrence of unnecessary characters, indicates an errorneous maintenance of
/// externalized resources, and such should be detected as soon as possible.
///
/// The main interface into this class is given with the overloaded #Get methods.
/// Enum Records are usually rather simple structs, consisting of strings, characters, integers
/// and floating point values. If so, a simple list of invocations of #Get for each
/// field of the struct has to be placed in implementations of the method
/// \note
///   This is the only occasion where any \alib module throws an exception of type \c std.
///   If (in presence of the module \alib_exceptions) an \alib{exceptions;Exception} was thrown,
///   this had to be resourced likewise.
///   The rationale for this design decision is that enum records usually are defined by
///   potentially externalized resources. The maintenance of such resources must not lead to
///   corrupted exceptions that are thrown when parsing those resources.
///   Consequently, the exception messages are using the English language and are not externalized.
///   An end user will not be faced with these exceptions unless an errorneous "roll-out"
///   of software using malicious externalized resources was performed.{enumrecords;EnumRecordPrototype::Parse}. For the last field, the optional parameter
/// \p{isLastField} has to be given as \c true4.
/// As an example, the following code shows the implementation of \alib{variables;Declaration::Parse}:
/// \snippet "variables/vmeta.cpp"     DOX_ENUMS_RECORD_PARSER
/// This parse method omits reading the value for inherited field
/// \alib{enumrecords;ERSerializable::MinimumRecognitionLength}, and sets it to fixed \c 0 instead.
/// This is often an option when custom enumeration record types
/// are derived from \b ERSerializable but are not supposed to be deserialized, or deserialization
/// forcing the whole string to read is acceptable.
/// Note that it is still possible to deserialize elements, but not with abbreviated names.
///
/// An implementation for a custom record type might perform more complex parsing operations.
/// For this, some helper methods are publicly provided, and finally, the direct use of the
/// substring #Input is likewise allowed.
