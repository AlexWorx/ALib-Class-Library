ALIB_EXPORT namespace alib { namespace containers {

/// This type implements a container used for caching objects. When its #Size reaches its #Capacity,
/// one of the least recently used (LRU) objects is replaced with the next insertion of a non-cached
/// object.
///
/// This implementation uses an array of lists. The lists are forward lists of cached elements
/// sorted by their insertion time, with the latest insertion in the front.
/// The list (within the array of lists) used to store and later search an object, is chosen by
/// the hash value of its key, modulo the number of lists in place.
/// Both, the size of the lists as well the number of lists (the size of the array) can be chosen
/// on construction or with method #Reserve.
/// The memory needed for all entries (and the array of pointers to the start of the list)
/// is allocated once, when the capacity is set. Generic allocation options (heap-, monotonic-
/// and pool allocation) are given with template parameter \p{TAllocator}.<br>
/// Together with the custom data, the hashcode of the key of the data is stored with each element.
/// This can reduce search time dramatically in some cases, because the equal functor is invoked
/// only if two objects have the same hashcode.
///
/// This design has the following consequences:
/// - The maximum amount of objects stored, equals the product of the size of the hash-array
///   and the maximum size of the list.
/// - The maximum number of comparisons performed before a cache miss is detected, equals
///   the maximum size of the lists.
/// - The \b last recently used object is always found with only one comparison. The probability
///   that other previously used objects (the second last, third last, etc) are likewise found
///   with only one comparison, rises with the size of the array of lists.
/// - This container does not necessarily free the least recently used object with the insertion
///   of an unknown one. Instead, the least recently used object of those cached objects whose hash
///   function leads to the same list index is freed.
///
/// As a sample, two reasonable use cases taken from \alib should be quickly discussed:
/// 1. Class \alib{files;OwnerAndGroupResolver} of camp \alib_files:
///    - The type translates owner and group IDs of files to corresponding owner and group names.
///    - For this, the OS has to be called.
///    - If for example a directory listing similar to bash command <c>ls -la</c> is to be printed,
///      the entries in a directory usually share the same owner with very few exceptions.
///      This is true for home directories inside <c>/home</c> as well as for system directories
///      like <c>/usr/bin</c>.
///    - A perfect exception is directory <c>/home</c> itself. Here, every subfolder belongs to a
///      different owner.
///
///    This sample shows that already a very small cache capacity can dramatically decrease the
///    number of calls to the OS. On the other hand, in the case of the exceptional folders, still
///    the number of searches performed before a cache-miss is detected is limited to the length
///    of the lists and not to the total capacity.
///    The default capacity of the \b %LRUCacheTable chosen by class \b OwnerAndGroupResolver is
///    <c>6 x 6</c> and can be changed with
///    \alib{files::OwnerAndGroupResolver;SetOwnerCacheCapacity} and
///    \alib{files::OwnerAndGroupResolver;SetGroupCacheCapacity}.
/// 2. Camp \alib_alox:
///    - With each log operation the placement of the call in a sourcefile (\alib{lox;Scope})
///      is evaluated to resolve the resulting
///      \"\ref alib_mod_alox_tak_terminology_domains "Log Domain"\".
///    - For this, the source file name given by the C++ preprocessor, is to be parsed.
///    - \alox uses an \b %LRUCacheTable to avoid parsing repetitive scopes.
///    - It is very much depending on the use case of logging, how often repetitive scopes occur.
///      For example if verbose logging is active, series of log statements comming from the same
///      code entity should be expected. If logging is limited and furthermore logging is made
///      in parallel by multiple threads, then the scopes should be rather mixed, but still
///      resulting from a limited number of files during a certain period of execution time.
///
///    The default capacity of the \b %LRUCacheTable chosen by \alib is likewise <c>4 x 6</c>
///    and can be changed with \alib{lox;Lox::SetFileNameCacheCapacity}.
///
/// Choosing the right values for the two dimensions of the capacity, depends on different
/// factors of the specific use case, and in most cases cannot be chosen to be perfect in
/// all situations. Among the things to consider are:
/// - The costs of creating a new object.
/// - The cost of comparing two keys.
/// - The statistical distribution of requests on (subsequent) objects. In cases of even
///   distribution, the use of this type can become counter-productive!
/// - Potential memory constraints of the target platform, which may limit the capacity to set.
///
/// The stored type is not restricted in respect to complexity or construction, destruction, copy
/// and move semantics, etc. This is reached by deferring construction to
/// the caller of method #Try, who, in case of a cache miss, is obligated to duly use a
/// C++ placement-new to construct an entry.
///
/// This class provides a forward-iterator type that fetches all currently cached elements.
/// While this in most cases is not needed, the central interface method #Try also returns an
/// iterator. While this iterator is always valid, a second returned value indicates whether also
/// the element the iterator points to is valid. This distinction is necessary, because this
/// container only reserves memory for the cached element, but it does not construct one.
/// To support elegant construction of elements, the iterator class provides method
/// \alib{containers::LRUCacheTable::TForwardIterator;Construct}.
/// Furthermore, methods
/// \alib{containers::LRUCacheTable::TForwardIterator;Key} and
/// \alib{containers::LRUCacheTable::TForwardIterator;Mapped} allow access to the stored types.
///
/// @see
/// - Type definitions \alib{containers;LRUCacheSet} and
///   \alib{containers;LRUCacheMap} based on this type.
/// - The approach to distinguish between "sets", "maps" and "sets with embedded keys" are
///   the same with class \b %HashTable. Therefore, the
///   \ref alib_ns_containers_hashtable_setandmap "documentation of class HashTable", which introduces
///   the same template parameter \p{TValueDescriptor} and also provides similar type definitions
///   \b %HashSet and \b %HashMap, is very helpful to understanding the concept of this type.
