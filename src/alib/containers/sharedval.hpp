/// This templated class is an alternative for C++ standard library type
/// \https{std::shared_ptr,en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr}
/// with important restrictions:
/// - Instead of managing a pointer, a \b value is managed.
/// - It is not possible to store derived types within this type, which is a common use case with
///   <c>std::shared_ptr</c>, especially in consideration with dynamic (virtual) types.<br>
///   This implies that no abstract types can be stored.
/// - This implementation misses the coexistence of sibling type <c>std::weak_ptr</c> and
///   corresponding functionality.
/// - This implementation misses an equivalent to method <c>owner_before</c> and corresponding
///   comparison operators.
/// - This implementation misses dedicated array support (at least as of today).
///
/// The advantages are:
/// - The type has a footprint of only <c>sizeof(void*)</c>, where the standard's type has
///   a size of two pointers.
/// - An internal second pointer-dereferencing is avoided when accessing the shared value.
/// - The type performs only one allocation.
///   (Common implementations of the standard's type perform two allocations.)
/// - The type supports storing references to \alib {lang;Allocator;allocators} which are
///   used for allocation and freeing of memory.
///   Allocators can be of "heavy" weight and are never copied by value.
///
/// Note that despite being named <b>Shared<em><u>Val</u></em></b>, which is in contrast to
/// sibling type <b>Shared<em><u>Ptr</u></em></b>, the type still behaves like a pointer.
/// It can be \e nulled, value <c>nullptr</c> can be assigned, and member access is performed
/// with the <c>operator-></c>. And of-course the object is destructed, and the memory is freed in
/// case the last copy of an instance is nulled or gets out of scope. A different naming
/// proposal could have been <b>Shared<em><u>Static</u></em>Ptr</b> to indicate that no
/// dynamic conversions and abstract types are applicable.
///
/// \see
///   - Class \alib{containers;SharedPtr} which allows storing derived, dynamic types.
///   - Class \alib{monomem;TSharedMonoVal} of module \alib_monomem, which incorporates
///     an own embedded instance of class \alib{monomem;TMonoAllocator}.
///     This allocator can be used for further monotonic allocations by the contained type or
///     other code entities that receive the shared pointer.
/// @tparam T           The custom type that is shared with this pointer.
/// @tparam TAllocator  The allocator that is used to allocate an instance of \p{T} together
///                     with a reference counter and optionally a reference to such allocator
///                     if passed with construction.
