/// This templated class lifts restrictions imposed by (otherwise slightly more efficient)
/// class \alib{containers;SharedVal} and is an almost full-featured alternative for
/// C++ standard library type
/// \https{std::shared_ptr,en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr}.
///
/// What is missing compared to <c>std::shared_ptr</c>:
/// - Pointers to externally allocated objects cannot be assigned.
///   The shared objects are always created with construction of this class or with method
///   #InsertDerived .
/// - Special method #InsertDerived is to be used, in case types derived from \p{T} are to be
///   placed inside.
/// - Overall, the interface is more explicit and seems less convenient.
/// - This implementation misses the coexistence of sibling type <c>std::weak_ptr</c> and
///   corresponding functionality.
/// - This implementation misses an equivalent to method <c>owner_before</c> and corresponding
///   comparison operators.
/// - This implementation misses dedicated array support (at least as of today).
/// 
/// Advantages are:
/// - The type has a footprint of only <c>sizeof(void*)</c>, where the standard's type has
///   a size of two pointers.
/// - The type performs only one allocation.
///   (Common implementations of the standard's type perform two allocations.)
/// - The type supports storing references to \alib {lang;Allocator;allocators} which are
///   used for allocation and freeing of memory. (In this case, of course, the footprint
///   increases to two times the <c>sizeof(void*)</c>.)
///
/// \see
///   - Sibling class \alib{containers;SharedVal}, with is a restricted but slightly more efficient
///     version of this class.
///   - Class \alib{monomem;TSharedMonoVal} of module \alib_monomem, which incorporates
///     an own embedded instance of class \alib{monomem;TMonoAllocator}.
///     This allocator can be used for further monotonic allocations by the contained type or
///     other code entities that receive the shared pointer.
/// @tparam T           The custom type that is shared with this pointer.
/// @tparam TAllocator  The allocator that is used to allocate an instance of \p{T} together
///                     with a reference counter and optionally a reference to such allocator
///                     if passed with construction.
