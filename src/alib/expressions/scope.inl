/// This class acts as a simple virtual container to store custom resources in
/// \alib{expressions;Scope} objects.
///
/// To do so, custom derived types would simply add a custom member object together with a virtual
/// destructor that ensures that the member object(s) get rightfully deleted.
///
/// Instances of this type have to be created using the scope's allocator and are to be stored in
/// in container
/// \doxlinkproblem{structalib_1_1expressions_1_1Scope.html;a45b12fe152f8e6a90341987ef35c958e;Scope::NamedResources}.

/// This type is used as the default class to provide access to program data when evaluating
/// \alib expressions.
/// Usually a derived type which contains references to necessary application data is passed to
/// the method \alib{expressions;ExpressionVal::Evaluate}.
/// Then, custom callback functions may cast instances of this type that they receive back to
/// the derived type and access such application-specific data.
///
/// Also, scope objects are used to store intermediate results as well as the final one,
/// in the case that such results are not of a simple type that can be boxed
/// \alib{boxing;Box} "by value".
///
/// For this, two different allocator objects are provided. One for compile-time results and
/// one for those needed at evaluation-time.
///
/// A scope object can be reused for evaluating the same expression several times.
/// Before the evaluation, the custom "scoped data" has to be set.
/// With each reuse, the method #Reset will be invoked internally.
/// Hence, if custom storage members are added in derived types, this method has
/// to be overwritten to a) invoke the original method and b) clean such custom types.
///
/// One singleton of this type, which is used to store compile-time data, is created with the
/// virtual method \alib{expressions;Compiler::createCompileTimeScope}.
/// If compile-time invokable custom callback methods use custom storage allocators, this method
/// has to be overridden to return the proper custom version of this class.
/// (Note, this is not needed for the evaluation-time instances, as this is created in the custom
/// code unit anyhow and passed to method \alib{expressions;ExpressionVal::Evaluate}).
///
/// \see
///  - For details on the use of scopes see the manual chapter \ref alib_expressions_scopes.
///  - This is an almost completely public struct.
///    The design rationale behind this is explained in the manual chapter
