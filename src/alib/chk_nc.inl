ALIB_EXPORT namespace alib {
    /// This tag-type is used across \alib to indicate that no check of the input parameters should
    /// be performed.
    /// Methods affected expose a template parameter named \p{TCheck} which usually defaults to
    /// this types' counterpart \alib{CHK}.
    ///
    /// For example, various methods of the \alib string types, which perform range-checks on
    /// string-indices, use this template parameter.
    /// With debug-compilations the checks are still made, and if they fail, the parameters are not
    /// corrected, but instead an \alib assertion is raised.
    /// In release builds, however, no checks are performed, which improves execution speed.
    ///
    /// A programmer does not notice the existence of this option, unless he consults the
    /// corresponding method's reference documentation, because of the default-value \alib{CHK}.
    /// Only with code critical to performance or size, the parameter might be crucial to give.
    ///
    /// \note This type, as well as sibling type \alib{CHK} should rather reside in namespace
    ///       #alib::lang, but was placed in the libraries root namespace for convenience and shortness
    ///       of string-concatenation sequences of the using-code.
