ALIB_EXPORT namespace alib {  namespace threads {

// =================================================================================================
/// This class is a simple wrapper around C++ standard library type \c std::shared_timed_mutex.
/// Thus, it is used to implement <em>mutual exclusive access</em> to resources by protecting
/// critical code sections from being executed in parallel in concurrent threads, while
/// allowing typical read-operations to continue to be executed in parallel. <br>
/// With release-compilations, the only difference to using \c std::shared_timed_mutex directly
/// is that "spurious wake-ups" are detected and mitigated by this implementation.
///
/// When a pair of #Acquire and #Release invocations is performed within the same code block, then
/// it is recommended to use a stack instantiation of class \alib{lang;Owner} to acquire and release
/// objects of this class.
/// Such a use is highly simplified with macros \ref ALIB_LOCK and \ref ALIB_LOCK_WITH. <br>
/// The same is recommended for paired invocations of #AcquireShared and #ReleaseShared.
/// Here, class \alib{lang;OwnerShared} is to be used, best using macros \ref ALIB_LOCK_SHARED and
/// \ref ALIB_LOCK_SHARED_WITH.
///
/// This class does not allow nested calls to the method #Acquire - method #Release has to be
/// invoked (from within the same thread that acquired this mutex), before any other thread can
/// again gain access. Nested acquisitions constitute undefined behavior.
///
/// \par Debug-Features
/// Public member #Dbg is available with debug-compilations. It offers the following features:
/// - An assertion is raised when nested use is performed.
/// - The object stores the actual owning thread and the source code position of the last
///   acquirement.
///   Likewise the last shared acquirement's caller information is stored.
/// - Releasing non-acquired instances, as well as destructing acquired one,
///   \ref alib_mod_assert "raises an ALib error".
/// - Field \alib{threads;DbgLockAsserter;WaitTimeLimit} the raise of \alib warnings in case a
///   certain wait time is exceeded.
/// - Field #DbgWarningMaximumShared enables the raise of \alib warnings in the case that
///   the number of parallel shared acquirements reaches the limit given with this member.
///
/// \par Availability
/// This type is not available if the compiler-symbol \ref ALIB_SINGLE_THREADED is set.
///
/// @see
///  - Chapter \ref alib_threads_locks of the Programmer's Manual of the module \alib_threads_nl.
///  - Chapter \ref alib_manual_appendix_callerinfo of the General Programmer's Manual.
