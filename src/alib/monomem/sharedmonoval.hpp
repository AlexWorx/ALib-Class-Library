//==================================================================================================
/// This templated class is a utility type for \alib{monomem;TMonoAllocator} and supports the
/// following mechanics:
/// - It creates a first \alib{monomem;detail::Buffer;buffer} usable by a \b MonoAllocator.
/// - A custom type defined by template parameter \p{T} is placed at the beginning of
///   that buffer.
/// - Along with the custom type, the \b MonoAllocator that receives this first buffer is likewise
///   emplaced in the buffer.
/// - Finally, an atomic usage counter is placed as a third member inside that buffer.
/// - Only one pointer into this first buffer is stored with this type.
/// - This type overloads #operator->() and #operator*() to access the members of the custom type.
/// - The concept of an "automatic pointer", similar to <c>std::shared_ptr</c> is
///   implemented with this type.
/// - The default-constructor of this type just sets the internal pointer to \c nullptr.
///
/// All of the above results in the following:
/// - The size of an instance of this class is equal to the size of a single C++ pointer.
///   The only member is a pointer to an object of internal type
///   \alib{monomem::TSharedMonoVal;FieldMembers}.
/// - A single dynamic memory allocation is performed to create an instance of the class, which
///   holds all data and allows further monotonic allocations.
/// - Values of this type are \e nulled, when default constructed.
/// - Values of this type can be shared (copied as value), which increases the use counter.
/// - Values of this type can be moved, which keeps the use counter as is.
/// - Values of this type can be emptied by assigning \c nullptr or invoking #SetNulled.
/// - At the moment that the last copy gets out of scope, is deleted or \e nulled,
///   the contained object is destructed, and all monotonic memory is freed.
/// - The allocator can be received with #GetAllocator and used by the contained type.
///   A derived type may volunteer to publish the allocator as well to be used by any
///   entity that gets access to a copy of the automatic pointer.
/// - Member access is performed with the overloaded <c>operator->()</c>.
///   Alternatively (and sometimes needed) other provided operators and methods like #Get may
///   be used.
///
/// In contrast to the container types \alib{containers;SharedVal} and \alib{containers;SharedPtr},
/// this type is <b>most commonly used as a base class</b> of types that should to be fully
/// self-contained (like the types listed below).
///
/// \see
///   - A step by step sample that can be used to bootstrap custom usages is presented in chapter
///     \ref alib_contmono_smv of the Programmer's Manual of this \alibmod.
///   - The following types found across \alib may be reviewed for understanding this type's usage
///     and its potential use cases:
