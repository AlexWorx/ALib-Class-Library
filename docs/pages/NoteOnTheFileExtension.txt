The files in this folder with extension ".md" are not markdown files.
Instead, they are doxygen input files.

The reason why they are named .md is that CLion/Grazie-Plugin does not
perform grammar checks on .dox files (as of today we could not make it work!)
Furthermore, naming them .md gives a first preview in CLion, even though the doxygen
links and some other stuff do not work.

As we do not use Markdown otherwise with doxygen, we could tell doxygen to
see ".md" files as C++ input files. This way, doxygen properly reads the
files as non-markdown.
