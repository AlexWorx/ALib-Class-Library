\mainpage    Overview

## Abstract ##

\alib is a general purpose, use-case agnostic, platform-independent, low-level C++ class library.

Its mission is to provide foundational concepts, types, and idioms relevant to any C++ project.
As of today, \alib consists of \ref alib_manual_modules_graph "25 modules", each addressing
different topics.<br>
A subset of the available modules can be selectively included in a custom library build.
This means you just get what you choose from the menu.

## New In this Version ##
Dropped support of language version C++17. With that:
- All use of <c>std::enable_if</c> (and similar) have been replaced by <b>C++20 Concepts</b>.  
- Support for <b>C++20 Modules</b> was added. (This is in alpha state and works only on newest Clang 
  compilers).

The latter was a little bit of a journey, and we have created a blog-page describing our 
experiences. Here it is: \ref alib_c20module_shift.
                                                                         
For more news, consult the \ref alib_changelog.

## Some highlights of the functionality ##
- Module \alib_strings: String-types with interfaces similar to Java/C#, compatible with anything that 
  "smells" like a string. 
  (Technically, this is achieved by using some \ref alib_manual_appendix_tca "type traits" magic.)
- Module \alib_boxing: Consider this as "std::any on steroids".
- Modules \alib_enumops and \alib_enumrecords: Finally, we get what we expected from C++ enums.
- Module \alib_monomem: Monotonic allocation with recycling. Why use the oh-so-slow heap?
- Module \ref alib_mod_alox "ALox": Logging for adults.
- Module \alib_bitbuffer: Write bit-streams instead of human-readable text.
- Module \alib_cli: Command line parser with support of environment variables and configuration files.
- Module \alib_expressions: Type-safe run-time expression compiler. Easily extensible to support your
  custom expression functions. 130+ (optional) predefined functions (math, string compare, date/time, etc.)
- Module \alib_variables: Run-time variables for C++. 
  Its priority-management allows hard-coding defaults and having them be overridden by
  configuration files, environment-variables or command-line parameters.  
- Module \alib_files: A directory and file scanner (with run-time expression support).
- Module \alib_format: Formatting of strings with Python-like and alternatively Java-like syntax.
- Module \alib_threadmodel: A dynamic thread-pool implementation, dedicated worker threads with prioritized
  job-management, and periodic event-triggering.
- And last but not least: Many more tools like managing bootstrapping of C++ software, externalized resources,
  configuration data, singletons with Windows DLLs, ...

## Main Characteristics And Design Goals ##

- \alib is <b>free software</b>.
- Compiles with standards <b>C++20 and 23</b>.
- \b Modularization: Possible selective use of only parts of the library.
- Extensive \b documentation.
- <b>Least intrusive</b>: Designed to keep user code as independent of \alib types and idioms as possible.
- <b>Ease of use</b> by design.<br>
  When things become complex, features are hidden behind default
  behavior and are only available to users who read the detail chapters of the various Programmer's Manuals.  \emoji :sweat_smile:
- Developed and steadily tested under <b>GNU/Linux</b>, <b>Windows OS</b>, <b>Mac OS</b>, and
  <b>Raspberry</b>. For details in respect to the current release, see section below.

## Documentation ##

The following documentation is provided.

1. A \ref alib_manual "General Library Manual" is available describing the library structure,
   its setup and compilation, bootstrapping, etc.

2. \b 25 separated \ref alib_manual_modules_table "Programmer's Manuals" are published
   on this website! (One for each \alibmod_nl).<br>
   The manuals are well-structured, provide <b>step-by-step source-code tutorials</b> and 
   often go into in-depth discussions in respect to design decisions and overall
   rationals behind important features of the \alibmods.

3. \ref alib "Reference Documentation" which is covering 100% of the provided types, members,
   functions, namespaces, macros, etc. In short, <b>each and every C++ entity is documented</b>.

4. A detailed version history, documenting every interface change is found in the \ref alib_changelog.

5. All documentation provided leverages the full power of \https{Doxygen,doxygen.nl} (the industry standard).
   Therefore, changes in the library's interfaces are always detected and corrected.
   The many <b>code samples</b> are implemented as unit tests and thus are "live"-integrated
   to the documentation, often together with the output text snippets of the recent unit test run.
   (See \ref alib_expressions_calculator "an example here".)

\note
   Summary: \alib comes with a <b>complete book of documentation</b>, which has more than
   <b>1000 pages</b> if printed. Its all explained, for beginners and experts!

##  C# and Java Versions Of ALib ##

Parts of \alib have sibling incarnations in programming languages C# and JAVA. Historically,
\alib aimed to be a cross platform/cross language library. This goal was (mostly) dropped
in favor to be able to independently develop <b>ALib for C++</b>.

<b>ALib for C#</b> and <b>ALib for Java</b> are included in and distributed with the
cross platform \https{ALox Logging Library,alexworx.github.io/ALox-Logging-Library/}.

For C++, since May 2018 release, the situation was inverted: Instead of having \alib bundled
with \alox, the logging library is now an \alibmod.

\anchor mainpage_license
## License ##

\alib is free software, can be \https{downloaded at Github,github.com/AlexWorx/ALib-Class-Library}
and sources are published under Boost Software License:

\verbinclude "../../LICENSE.txt"

## Library Dependencies ##

\alib compiles as is, hence it is <b>not dependent on any 3rd-party library</b>.
Optional dependencies exist. For example if \https{boost,www.boost.org} is available,
\alib_strings_nl are using its regex search.<br>
In contrast, \alib provides optional compatibility headers for 3rd-party libraries
(e.g., \https{QT Class Library,www.qt.io}), which for example provide adoptions of \alib type-traits
for QT-types.

##  Contributions ##
We would be happy, if the community started to support this library and are willing to receive
contributions and, if accepted, to update the code accordingly.<br>
Note that for legal reasons, we hereby explicitly refuse and reject code (or ideas for code)
that are not explicitly provided under the Boost Software License.
Please do not even contact us with your ideas/code in that case.
