\mainpage    Overview

## Abstract ##

\alib is a general purpose, use-case agnostic, platform independent, low-level C++ class library.

Its mission is to provide foundational concepts, types and idioms relevant to any C++ project.
As of today, \alib consists of \ref alib_manual_modules_dependencies "16 modules", each addressing
different topics like for example
\"\ref alib_mod_boxing "boxing arbitrary values"\",
\"\ref alib_mod_text "character string formatting"\", or
\"\ref alib_mod_expressions "regular expression parsing"\".<br>
A subset of the available modules can be selectively included in a custom library build.

## Main Characteristics And Design Goals ##

- \alib is <b>free software</b>.
- The minimum C++ language standard is <b>C++ 11</b>, selective support for more modern C++
  versions included.
- \b Modularization: Possible selective use of only parts of the library.
- Extensive \b documentation.
- <b>Least intrusive</b>: Designed to keep user code as independent from \alib types and idioms as possible.
- Developed and steadily tested under <b>GNU/Linux</b>, <b>Windows OS</b> and <b>Mac OS</b>
  with compilers GNU,  Clang and Microsoft Visual C++.

## Library Dependencies ##

\alib compiles as is, hence it is <b>not dependent on any 3rd-party library</b>.
Optional dependencies exist. For example if \https{boost,www.boost.org} is available,
\alib_strings_nl are using its regex search.<br>
In contrast, \alib provides optional compatibility headers for 3rd-party libraries
(e.g. \https{QT Class Library,www.qt.io}), which for example provide adoptions of \alib type-traits
for QT-types.

## Documentation ##

The following documentation is provided.

1. \ref aworx::lib "Reference Documentation" covering 100% of types, members, functions, namespaces, macros
   and other C++ entities.

2. \ref alib_manual_modules_overview "Programmer's Manuals" are available for (almost)
   each \alibmod_nl.<br>
   Together more than <b>450 pages</b> of well structured in-depth discussion of library
   features as well as <b>step by step tutorials</b> are available.

3. Page \ref alib_changelog provides a detailed version history.

4. A separated \ref alib_manual_modules "General Manual" is available describing the library structure,
   project setup, bootstrapping, etc.

5. Reference documentation of C++ \ref alib_ref_prepro "compiler symbols and macros".

6. Tutorial and reference documentation's <b> code samples</b> are implemented as unit tests and
   are integrated as source and output text snippets into the documentation.
   (As for example as \ref alib_enums_records "done here").

7. For module \alib_alox, a
   \https{separated website,alexworx.github.io/ALox-Logging-Library/index.html} exists.
   This includes plenty of \alox specific documentation, a lengthy
   \https{tutorial,alexworx.github.io/ALox-Logging-Library/cpp_ref/alox_cpp_tutorial.html}, definitions of
   \https{configuration/environment variables,alexworx.github.io/ALox-Logging-Library/group__GrpALoxConfigVars.html}
   and more.


## IDE / Build System Setup ##

    - \https{clang compiler 9.0.0,llvm.org/}
    - \https{CMake 3.16,cmake.org/}
    - \https{CLion 2019.3,www.jetbrains.com/cpp}
    - \http{Valgrind V. 3.15.0,valgrind.org/}

- Windows 10
    - Visual Studio 2017, Version 15.9.18

- macOS Catalina 10.15.1
    - Apple Clang Version 11.0.0
    - \https{CLion 2019.3.1,www.jetbrains.com/cpp}

Check out chapter \ref alib_manual_build "4. Building The Library" for details of how to compile
and use ALib in your C++ environment.


##  C# and Java Versions Of ALib ##

Parts of \alib have sibling incarnations in programming languages C# and JAVA. Historically,
\alib aimed to be a cross platform/cross language library. This goal was (mostly) dropped
in favour to be able to independently develop <b>ALib for C++</b>.

<b>ALib for C#</b> and <b>ALib for Java</b> are included in and distributed with the
cross platform \https{ALox Logging Library,alexworx.github.io/ALox-Logging-Library/}.

For C++, since May 2018 release, the situation was inverted: Instead of having \alib bundled
with \alox, the logging library is now an \alibmod.
